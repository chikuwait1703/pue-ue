Here's some info on how development works in this project:

The `main` branch is the version of the last release. \
`patch` level PRs, for example bugs or critical library updates, should be merged into `main` directly. \
A new `patch` release is usually published shortly after the PR is accepted.

New features should branch of the `development` branch. \
