This is the shared library used by the [Pueue](https://github.com/nukesor/pueue/) client and daemon.

It can also be used by third-party software to, for instance, to communicate with the Pueue daemon.

## Contributing

Feature requests and pull requests are very much appreciated and welcome!

Anyhow, please talk to me a bit about your ideas before you start hacking!
It's always nice to know what you're working on and I might have a few suggestions or tips :)

There's also the [Architecture Guide](https://github.com/Nukesor/pueue/blob/main/ARCHITECTURE.md), which is supposed to give you a brief overview and introduction to the project.
